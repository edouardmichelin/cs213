# Workflow
Collaborators will work on their own branches that they will create from a main working branch, which will then be merged to this main branch via a pull request.

**Main branches** are branches that do not contain a description in their name as they do not need one (e.g.: `feature/assignment-3`).

In order to pull the main branch for a given assignment so that collaborators can then create each of their branches, the following commands will have to be executed:
- if the branch does not exist locally
`git fetch`
`git switch main_branch_name`
`git checkout -b own_branch`
- if the branch already exist in the local repository
`git checkout main_branch_name`
`git pull`
`git checkout -b own_branch`

In order to push their branch to the remote repository, collaborators will need to link it by executing the following command:
`git push --set-upstream origin own_branch`

They can then visit the page of their branch on GitHub and create a pull request. Make sure that the target (the main branch) is the correct one as GitHub will set `dev` by default.

# Branches
If an assignment is split into different parts, then each part should have its own branch.

## Naming
We will name branches using the pattern `[type]/[assignment/scope]/[short description]`.

- `type` can be one of the following: `release`, `feature` or `hotfix`
- `assignment/scope` is `assignement-` followed by the number of the assignment for a "main" branch or `assignment` followed by the number of the assignment if a "short description" follows (e.g.: `assignment-3` or `assignment3`)
- `short description` is a short, url encoded, description (e.g.: `add-green-button`, `part-4` or `julien`)

Following this pattern,
- a branch on which Edouard will implement his version of assignment 4 will be named `feature/assignment4/edouard`
- a branch on which Lilou will do part 3 of assignment 8 will be named `feature/assignment8/part-3`
- a branch on which Julien will fix a bug on a release, described in issue 2, right before the grading of the 8 first assignments will be named `hotfix/assignment8/issue-2`
- the working (feature) branch for assignment 12 will be named `feature/assignment-12`
#### Notes
Up to week 5 - included - assignments will be individual, meaning that we are all going to do the same work. This will result in `short description` simply being the name of the branch owner.

# Commit messages
If a part is split into different subparts, then each subpart should have its own commit - when possible

Commit messages will be written in english, following the pattern: `[type] - [name] - [description]`
- `type` will either be `script` if a script was modified or `scene` if a scene was modified
- `name` will be the name of the script or scene that was modified (e.g. `core/config` for the script located at `Assets/Scripts/Core/Config.cs` or `menu` for the scene located at `Assets/Scenes/Menu`)
- `description` is a simple yet complete description of the changes - it can be the name of a subpart (e.g.: `Part 3.2` for changes recquired by subpart 2 of part 3)

Following this pattern,
- a commit related to part 5.2, recquiring changes on script PlayerMovement.cs will look like `script - PlayerMovement - Part 5.2`
# Merges
Contributors shall not directly merge to "main" branches (branches protection should prevent them from doing it). Once their part is done, they should submit a pull request, wait for approval and then squash their commits into a single one before merging without modifying the title of the commit generated by GitHub.
